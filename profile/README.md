# Welcome to the Data-Centric Design Lab

At the Data-Centric Design Lab, we develop methods and tools to leverage behavioural data in the design processes of PSS to better equip designers in tackling societal challenges. By integrating data science into Participatory Design, we build the foundations for ethical and collaborative design processes beyond Human-Centred Design. We generate this knowledge through the development and use of data centred prototypes and products together with designers, potential users and relevant authorities (e.g. HREC, ICT).
